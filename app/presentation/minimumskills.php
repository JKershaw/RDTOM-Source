	<p>The App is based on the 2013 WFTDA Minimum Skills Requirements, and breaks all you need to know down into the following categories:</p>

	<p>
	- Basic skills<br />
	- How many laps you can do in 5 minutes<br />
	- Recovery<br />
	- Balance & Agility<br />
	- Pack skills<br />
	- Blocking
	</p>
	<p>There's also a category for Rules; as part of your Minimum Skills you'll need to do a written rules test.</p>

	<p>Updates are due for the app to bring you all the requested features, so make sure to always get the very latest version. If you have any requests for features, please get in touch!</p>
