A place for everyone to chat about the rules, the site, and derby in general. \r\n\r\nIt\\\'s custom-made by me to fit the site, and it\\\'s very bare-bones right now. My goal is to update it as we go, taking feedback from you lot on what you want sorted soonest. What do we need first; embedded pictures of kittens, editing posts, allowing quotes, hyper-links, email reminders, nice formatting etc. I want to add all these things eventually, but they have to be done in an order.\r\n\r\nThese updates will also be completed alongside the larger updates to the site in general, and I\\\'m hoping the forum will become a very useful feedback mechanism for all that.\r\n\r\nPlus, we can use the forum for rules clarifications and questions.

Three days till bout day... I have been going through all the scenarios, and rules, and here\\\'s what I came up with:\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n6.13.36 - Skaters who begin in an intentionally taken starting position which purposefully prolongs that skater’s ability to return to an in-play position or a team’s ability to reform a pack (e.g., intentionally starting on one’s back, intentionally starting in a dog-pile), as this represents an intentional and immediate prolonged failure to rejoin/failure to reform. One penalty will be applied to a single skater per team, if applicable, who seems most responsible or the Pivot (further penalties should be assessed as laid out by rules 6.10.12 and 6.10.16).\r\n\r\n6.10.12 - A skater who, after being warned, does not immediately attempt to re-enter the Engagement Zone. A major penalty must be applied to each offending Blocker who does not attempt to return to the Engagement Zone.\r\n \r\n6.10.16 - No pack: After a warning, a sustained failure to reform a pack will result in a major penalty. This penalty includes a sustained failure to reform a pack by returning to in bounds from out of bounds. One penalty will be applied to a single skater per team, if applicable, who seems most responsible, or the Pivot (see Section 7.1.4).\r\n\r\nScenario 1:\r\nIf the blockers all line up touching the Jam line during their own power jam, and they all yield advantage to their own jammer, it is self defeating since you would always yield to your own jammer anyway, but since you cant make any forward motion, you also can\\\'t block opposing blockers for her. \r\n\r\nIf however, scenario 2, you position your blocker wall in front of the opposing blockers and encroach (legally) on them, they will be more likely to false start without being aware of it and will have to yield to your jammer or take the penalty.\r\n\r\nNow, scenario 3, starting with all of your blockers behind your jammer in your own power play: you sacrifice your pivot to the bin. Once the \\\"No Pack\\\" is called penalties will be given out if there is a \\\"sustained failure to reform\\\". So,since the blockers are \\\"a lap ahead\\\" of the pack, they would need to quickly skate clockwise on the track to reform or penalties will be called for \\\"failure to reform\\\". Each skater who doesn\\\'t immediately start skating \\\"back to the pack\\\" will get penalized. If they do go back right away, but the refs think it takes to long, only the most responsible person will be penalized.\r\n\r\n\r\nEssentially, the lineup would need to know exactly what is going on, and going over the rules with the refs at the beginning of the bout will be important so that it gives them  the opportunity to process what just happened.

A Jammer satisfies this requirement if any part of their foot or skate is the first point of contact upon landing, with no part of their body touching out of bounds at the point of initial contact with the track. Thus, if any part of the Jammer’s foot/skate has touched in-bounds at the moment of initial contact upon landing, the Jammer has immediately satisfied this requirement. Anything that happens after this point (falling, stepping out of bounds, etc.) is irrelevant to scoring, but will be taken into account for other rules purposes (such as cutting the track, low blocking, etc).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nJammer is completely in-bounds and ceases contact with the track as part of an apex jump. The first part of the Jammer’s body to contact the floor is their right foot, which makes contact in-bounds. The Jammer’s left foot then lands out of bounds.
